Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning

In this project, we ran machine learning algorithms and synthetic sampling techniques to classify and detect intrusions.

We used machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Decision tree and Random forest, and SMOTE for synthetic sampling of data. We performed the three ML algoithms once without
SMOTE and once with SMOTE and then compared the results.

Results:
Without any under/over-sampling techniques, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree have poor results, especially in R2L and U2R classes which are grossly undersampled.

Random Forest still performs relatively well.

But with the SMOTE oversampling technique, the results of Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest are drastically improved.
